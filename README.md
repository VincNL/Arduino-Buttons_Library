# Arduino-Buttons_Library
Library that identifies button's actions

For the library to work you also need my Timer library:
https://github.com/VincNL/Arduino-Timer_Library
Or
Extract the Arduino-Timer_Library.zip folder

For explanations about both of the libraries use the function help().
Please use the examples to learn how to use the functions correctly, without bugs or any delay.
